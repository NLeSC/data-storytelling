# The story map, a framework for story-building

We are all natural-born storytellers.
Or at the very least, storylisteners.
The same drive lies behind a gathering around the fireplace, a night at the movies or listening to a podcast on your morning run: our brain's hunger for narratives.
We are (almost literally) wired for it.

And yet creating a story can be challenging.

This tutorials presents a strategy for simplifying the creative process of building a story.

### What is a story?

If you ever experienced the so-called _"blank page syndrome"_, chances are that it originated not a lack of ideas to write about, but from an overwhelming unordered pile of them.

A story, any story, is linear.
It doesn't matter if it is a text, a speech, or a movie: it will progress from a beginning to an end.

> More specifically, any story will be **consumed** on a linear way.
> Even a story which content is structured in a non-chronological order has a beginning and an end.
