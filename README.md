# Data Storytelling @ eScience Center

Welcome to the repository for our **Tech Focus Project 2025: Data Storytelling**, part of the NLeSC initiative to enhance communication and accessibility of research software through compelling, AI-powered narratives.

This repository gathers all deliverables, research, tools, and demos created during the project.

> Goal: Help Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and scientists **present complex research outputs using storytelling techniques**, combining narrative design, data visualization, and AI tooling.

## Project Highlights (Deliverables & Milestones)

Below is the planned list of project deliverables, based on the proposal and current progress. We aim to complete these by December 2025 unless noted otherwise (In progress...).

- ✅ Literature Review: Systematic overview of data storytelling across domains
- ✅ Working AI Pipelines: Modular storytelling pipeline using small LLMs
- ⏳ Training Guide: Work-in-progress handbook for data storytelling in RSE
  - Best use of LLMs, RAG model quality analysis, etc.
  - Story generation quality metrics: structure, factual accuracy, engagement, etc.
- ⏳ Use Case Application: Storytelling applied to eScience evaluation project(s)
- ⏳ Showcase Outputs: Poster, website, and internal presentation planned for December
