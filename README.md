# 📊 Data Storytelling @ eScience Center

Welcome to the repository for our **Tech Focus Project 2025: Data Storytelling**, part of the NLeSC initiative to enhance communication and accessibility of research software through compelling, AI-powered narratives.

This repository gathers all deliverables, research, tools, and demos created during the project.

> 🧠 Goal: Help Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and scientists **present complex research outputs using storytelling techniques**, combining narrative design, data visualization, and AI tooling.
