Welcome to the repository for our **Tech Focus Project 2025: Data Storytelling**, part of the NLeSC initiative to enhance communication and accessibility of research software through compelling, AI-powered narratives.

This repository gathers all deliverables, research, tools, and demos created during the project.

> Goal: Help Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and scientists **present complex research outputs using storytelling techniques**, combining narrative design, data visualization, and AI tooling.

## Project Highlights (Deliverables & Milestones)

Below is the planned list of project deliverables, based on the proposal and current progress. We aim to complete these by December 2025 unless noted otherwise (In progress...).

- ✅ Literature Review: Systematic overview of data storytelling across domains
- ✅ Working AI Pipelines: Modular storytelling pipeline using small LLMs
- ✅ **Interactive Web Application**: 3D visualization platform with AI story generator ([webapp/](./webapp/))
- Training Guide: Work-in-progress handbook for data storytelling in RSE
  - Best use of LLMs, RAG model quality analysis, etc.
  - Story generation quality metrics: structure, factual accuracy, engagement, etc.
- Use Case Application: Storytelling applied to eScience evaluation project(s)
- Showcase Outputs: Poster, website, and internal presentation planned for December

## Web Application

The [`webapp/`](./webapp/) directory contains an interactive 3D visualization platform for exploring eScience Center research software projects.

### Key Features

- **3D Domain Exploration**: Navigate through four research domains (Life Sciences, Environment, Social Sciences, Engineering) with unique 3D visualizations
- **AI Story Generator**: Generate audience-specific narratives using Google Gemini:
  - Communications (general public)
  - Academic (scholarly)
  - Internal Review (leadership)
  - One Pager (executive summary)
- **Context Enrichment**: Include related software and uploaded documents for richer stories
- **Export Options**: Download stories as Markdown or PDF

See the [webapp README](./webapp/README.md) for setup and usage instructions.
